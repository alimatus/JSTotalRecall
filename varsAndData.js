Q + A

// How do we assign a value to a variable?
let =
const= 
var = ( old way)


// How do we change the value of a variable?
by reassigning it but we can not change const we will get error
ex a=5 can be a=6

// How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
setting it equal to old variable

let party = getlit

// Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
declare by using let, const, and var
assign value 
define inital value

// What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
pseudocoding is typing the logic behind a problem using your own words

we should use it to help us code better


// What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
80% of your time should be spend thinking about the logic and rest 20% actually coding

Strings

1. let firstVariable 

2. firstVariable = "Hello World"

3. firstVariable = 56

4. let secondVariable = firstVariable

5. secondVariable = ' This is a class assignment '

6. console.log(firstVariable) the value would be 56

const yourName = "Jean Valjean"

console.log ( "Hello, my name is " + yourName)

Booleans

const a = 4;
const b = 53;
const c = 57;
const d = 16;
const e = 'Kevin';

console.log(a < b);
console.log(c > d);
console.log('Name' === 'Name');
// FOR THE NEXT TWO, USE ONLY && OR ||
console.log(true || false);
console.log(false && false &&  false &&  false &&  false || true);
console.log(false === false)
console.log(e === 'Kevin');
console.log(a !== b <= c); // note: a < b < c is NOT CORRECT (and is not a valid JS expression, think about using other math operations)
console.log(a === a !== d); // note: the answer is a simple arithmetic equation, not something "weird"
console.log(48 !== '48');
